=== Performance Benchmark: Inline vs .rodata ===
Iterations: 1000000
Messages per iteration: 10
Total operations: 10000000

ðŸ“Š Results:
.rodata approach: 0 microseconds
Inline simulation: 0 microseconds

ðŸ’¾ Memory Analysis:
Inline approach estimated instruction overhead: ~1500 extra instructions per function
.rodata approach: 1 instruction per string access

=== Compile-Time Analysis ===
String lengths (computed at compile time):
"Short": 5 chars
"This is a much longer string": 28 chars
"OK": 2 chars

Compiler decision simulation:
"OK" (2 chars) â†’ Likely inline candidate
"Short" (5 chars) â†’ Borderline, depends on usage
"Long string" (28 chars) â†’ Definitely .rodata
