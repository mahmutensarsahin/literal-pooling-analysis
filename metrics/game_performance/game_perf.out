=== Cache Locality Analysis ===
🧭 Related UI strings addresses:
   "Health: ": 0x1005dbd0d
   "Mana: ": 0x1005dbd16 (offset: 9 bytes)
   "Experience: ": 0x1005dbd1d (offset: 16 bytes)
   "Level: ": 0x1005dbd2a (offset: 29 bytes)
   "Gold: ": 0x1005dbd32 (offset: 37 bytes)

📏 Analysis:
   Total memory span: 43 bytes
   Cache lines needed (64B): 1
   ✅ All strings fit in single cache line!

=== Key Takeaways for Game Development ===
✅ Use .rodata string literals instead of dynamic allocation
✅ Group related strings together for cache locality
✅ Use message IDs instead of storing string objects
✅ Pre-define message templates for common scenarios
✅ Organize localization data for efficient access
✅ Profile your actual game to validate optimizations
