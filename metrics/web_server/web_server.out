🐌 Running inefficient web server load test...
   Total test time: 1320ms
📊 Inefficient Web Server Performance Stats:
   Requests: 10000
   Allocations: 10000
   Avg response time: 0ms
   Cache hit ratio: 0%

🚀 Running optimized web server load test...
   Total test time: 668ms
📊 Optimized Web Server Performance Stats:
   Requests: 10000
   Allocations: 0
   Avg response time: 0ms
   Cache hit ratio: 83.3333%

=== HTTP Header Optimization Demo ===
📋 Common headers (stored in .rodata):
   Server: OptimizedWebServer/2.0
   Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
   Content-Encoding: gzip
   Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

✅ Benefits:
   - No string allocations for headers
   - Headers reused across all responses
   - Consistent memory usage regardless of traffic

📊 Connection Pooled Server Performance Stats:
   Requests: 10000
   Allocations: 0
   Avg response time: 0ms
   Cache hit ratio: 0%

🏆 Key Optimizations Achieved:
✅ Eliminated dynamic string allocations
✅ Used pre-computed response templates
✅ Implemented efficient response caching
✅ Reduced memory fragmentation
✅ Improved cache locality
✅ Enhanced concurrent performance

=== Production Deployment Considerations ===
🔧 Compile with: -O3 -march=native -flto -DNDEBUG
📊 Profile with: perf, Intel VTune, or similar tools
🔍 Monitor: Memory usage, response times, throughput
📈 Scale: Use connection pooling and async I/O
🛡️  Secure: Validate all inputs, prevent buffer overflows
